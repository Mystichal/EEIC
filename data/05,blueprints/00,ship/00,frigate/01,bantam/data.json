	"description": "Bantam Blueprint, used for industrial manufacturing.</br></br> In YC114 each other major empire faction, having been embroiled in a harrowing, war of attrition, recognized the growing need for support and logistics functionality in their vessels during the kind of protected interstellar warfare that might otherwise prove exhausting for its participants. In the Caldari State, this led to the redesing and redeployment of the Bantam.</br></br> The Bantam, a strong and sturdy craft, was originally an extremely effective mining frigate. After its redesing the Bantam's large structre had to give way for logistics systems that ate up some of its interior room but allowed it to focus extensively on shield support for fellow vessels."
